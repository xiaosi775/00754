Hi xiao,

 

We are reaching out to notify you about the scheduled maintenance time of the Infura Optimism mainnet endpoints during the Bedrock upgrade.

 

Optimism Maintenance Notice for June 6th 2023

 

Please note: Optimism will be in read only state with an expected decrease in performance during the mainnet bedrock upgrade.

 

The upgrade takes place on June 6th 2023 from 16:00 UTC and will run for approximately 4 hours

 

Please note the following during the upgrade.

Transactions, deposits, and withdrawals will be unavailable for the duration of the downtime, and the OP Mainnet chain will not be progressing.
Read access across most OP Mainnet nodes will stay online, but may see a slight decrease in performance during the migration process.
 

NOTE: Regular users will not need to take any actions related to the upgrade beyond preparing for the estimated 4 hours of read only state.
